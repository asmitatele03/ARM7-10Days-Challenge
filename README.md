# ARM7-10Days-Challenge
My 10-day learning challenge on ARM7 (LPC2129) covering GPIO, switch &amp; LED interfacing, counters, LCD, and embedded C.
🔹 About This Challenge

Documenting my 10-day learning journey on ARM7 (LPC2129).

Practising embedded C, GPIO, switches, LEDs, and register-level programming.

Each day includes code + output + short notes.

Building strong basics in embedded systems and hardware interaction.

Simple tasks → clear logic → consistent learning.
