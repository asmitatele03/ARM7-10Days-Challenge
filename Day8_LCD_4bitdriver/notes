Project Overview

In this task, the LCD is driven using a 4-bit communication protocol, where only the higher 4 data lines (D4–D7) are used. 
Commands and data are sent in two nibbles, which conserves GPIO pins and is widely used in embedded systems.

Concepts Used

✔ 4-bit LCD Interfacing

Only 4 data lines (D4–D7) are used, reducing pin requirements.
Commands like cursor movement and clear display (`0x01`) are used.

✔ DDRAM Addressing

* First row addresses range from 0x80 to 0x8F
* Updating this address moves the cursor position

✔ Simple Delay-Based Animation

A 'delay_ms(500)' creates the visible motion effect for each shift.

Code Used
for(i = 0; i < 16; i++)
{
    lcd_cmd(0x80 + i);   // Move cursor to next position
    lcd_data('A');       // Display character 'A'
    delay_ms(500);       // Delay for visual animation
    lcd_cmd(0x01);       // Clear the LCD before next position
}

Explanation

1. 'lcd_cmd(0x80 + i);'

   * 0x80 is the base command for the first row's DDRAM address.
   * Adding `i` shifts the cursor position from column 0 to column 15.

2. lcd_data('A');

   * Writes the character ‘A’ at the current position.

3. delay_ms(500);

   * Slows down the movement so the shift is visible to the user.

4. lcd_cmd(0x01);

   * Clears the screen before writing the character in the next location.
   * This creates a smooth “moving” single-character animation.

Outcome

By the end of Day 8, the LCD successfully displays a "moving ‘A’ animation" across the first row.
This exercise strengthens understanding of:

* LCD command structure
* Cursor addressing
* 4-bit communication
* Register-level control in ARM microcontrollers
* Timing and delays in embedded systems
