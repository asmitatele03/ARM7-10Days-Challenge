Project Overview

In this task, the LCD is driven using a 4-bit communication protocol, where only the higher 4 data lines (D4–D7) are used. 
Commands and data are sent in two nibbles, which conserves GPIO pins and is widely used in embedded systems.

## 🧠 **Concepts Used**

### ✔ 4-bit LCD Interfacing

Only 4 data lines (D4–D7) are used, reducing pin requirements.
Commands like cursor movement and clear display (`0x01`) are used.

### ✔ DDRAM Addressing

* First row addresses range from **0x80 to 0x8F**
* Updating this address moves the cursor position

### ✔ Simple Delay-Based Animation

A `delay_ms(500)` creates the visible motion effect for each shift.

## 🧾 **Code Used**

```c
for(i = 0; i < 16; i++)
{
    lcd_cmd(0x80 + i);   // Move cursor to next position
    lcd_data('A');       // Display character 'A'
    delay_ms(500);       // Delay for visual animation
    lcd_cmd(0x01);       // Clear the LCD before next position
}
```

## 📝 **Explanation**

1. **`lcd_cmd(0x80 + i);`**

   * 0x80 is the base command for the first row's DDRAM address.
   * Adding `i` shifts the cursor position from column 0 to column 15.

2. **`lcd_data('A');`**

   * Writes the character ‘A’ at the current position.

3. **`delay_ms(500);`**

   * Slows down the movement so the shift is visible to the user.

4. **`lcd_cmd(0x01);`**

   * Clears the screen before writing the character in the next location.
   * This creates a smooth “moving” single-character animation.

## 🎯 **Outcome**

By the end of Day 8, the LCD successfully displays a **moving ‘A’ animation** across the first row.
This exercise strengthens understanding of:

* LCD command structure
* Cursor addressing
* 4-bit communication
* Register-level control in ARM microcontrollers
* Timing and delays in embedded systems

## 🚀 **Future Improvements**

* Implement scrolling text
* Create custom characters using CGRAM
* Move characters on both rows
* Display full strings with animation
* Build a reusable LCD driver library
