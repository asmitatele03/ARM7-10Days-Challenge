📘 What This Program Does

The microcontroller starts counting numbers from 1 onwards.
For each number, it checks if the number is prime.
If the number is prime, the program will:

* Turn ON the LED corresponding to that prime number
* Keep it glowing for a short duration
* Turn it OFF again

This creates a visual representation of prime numbers using LEDs.

Example:
If the number 2 is prime → LED at bit position 2 glows
If the number 3 is prime → LED at bit position 3 glows
If the number 4 is not prime → no LED glows and so on.

📌 How Prime Number Detection Works

A number is prime if it has exactly two divisors:

1. 1
2. The number itself

The program checks this using a simple loop:

* It divides the number by every value from `1` to `i`
* Counts how many times the division remainder becomes zero
* If the count equals **2**, the number is prime

This divisor-counting method is straightforward and works well for demonstration.

💡 How LEDs Are Controlled

The LEDs are connected to **PORT0** (P0.0 to P0.7).
GPIO is set so that these pins act as **output pins**.

* `IOCLR0 = 1 << i;` → Turns ON the LED at position `i`
* `IOSET0 = 1 << i;` → Turns OFF the LED at position `i`

Each LED corresponds to a bit on the microcontroller port.

⚙️ Step-by-Step Operation

1. Configure the lower 8 pins of PORT0 as output.
2. Set all LEDs OFF initially.
3. Start checking numbers from 1, 2, 3, 4 … etc.
4. For each number:

   * Check if it is prime
   * If prime → Glow the LED briefly
   * If not → Do nothing
5. Move to the next number and repeat endlessly.

This makes the LEDs blink only for prime numbers, creating a visual pattern of prime-number distribution.
