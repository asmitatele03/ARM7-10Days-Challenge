8-bit LED Driver using LPC2148 GPIO | Embedded C

Today, I implemented an 8-bit LED driver using the LPC2148 microcontroller.
This challenge helped me understand how to control GPIO pins at the register level and interact with external switches.

🔧 What This Program Does

✔ Reads the state of a switch
✔ Toggles LEDs using an 8-bit pattern
✔ Uses register-level programming (IODIR0, IOSET0, IOCLR0)
✔ Implements a counter that resets after 8 cycles
✔ Demonstrates basic embedded C workflow for ARM7 (LPC2148)

🧠 Key Concepts Learned

ARM7TDMI GPIO architecture

Bit masking and shifting

Switch debouncing technique (while loop hold)

LED pattern generation

Delay and timing understanding

Register-level peripheral access

Simple driver-like behavior (input → processing → output)
