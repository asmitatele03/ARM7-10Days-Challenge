GPIO Input & Output in Embedded C (LPC2129)
Introduction--

This program demonstrates how to read a digital input pin and control an output pin using Embedded C on the LPC2129 (ARM7) microcontroller.
It uses basic bit manipulation, GPIO registers, and polling.
Register Explanation
IODIR0 (I/O Direction Register)

Controls direction of PORT0 pins

1 → Output
0 → Input

IODIR0 = 1 << 1 sets P0.1 as output.
IOPIN0 (I/O Pin Register)
Reads the current logic level of PORT0 pins

IOPIN0 >> 5 shifts bit 5 to bit 0

& 1 masks other bits

Used to check if switch on P0.5 is pressed.

IOSET0 (I/O Set Register)

Writing 1 to a bit sets that pin to HIGH

IOSET0 = 1 << 1 → Sets P0.1 HIGH.

IOCLR0 (I/O Clear Register)

Writing 1 to a bit clears that pin to LOW

IOCLR0 = 1 << 1 → Clears P0.1 LOW.

Working of the Program
Step-by-step:--

P0.1 is set as output (LED or any device connected).

P0.5 is read continuously inside an infinite loop.

If P0.5 = 0 (switch pressed → active low):

Clear P0.1 → LED turns ON.

If P0.5 = 1 (switch not pressed):

Set P0.1 → LED turns OFF.

Concepts Used--

Bit shifting (>>)

Bit masking (&)

Setting outputs using IOSET0

Clearing outputs using IOCLR0

Polling technique (continuous checking)

Active low logic

Applications--

This logic is used in:

Switch-based control

LED indicators

Input-driven actions

Device driver basics

Interrupt replacement (simple polling)

Summary--
This program helps beginners understand GPIO handling, bit manipulation, and low-level register programming on the LPC2129 microcontroller.
It forms the foundation for embedded systems, drivers, and real-time control.
