Demonstrates two-way switch behavior using the LPC2129 ARM7 microcontroller

The system continuously monitors the state of two input switches connected to P1.14 and P1.15

When any one of the switches is pressed, the microcontroller detects the HIGH logic level

Based on the input condition, the LED connected to P0.17 turns ON

When both switches are released, the LED automatically turns OFF

GPIO pins are configured using IODIR registers for proper input and output operation

Switch status is read in real time using the IOPIN1 register

Bitwise operations are used to isolate and evaluate individual pin states

Illustrates real-time digital input processing in an embedded system

Helps understand the basic working behavior of GPIO control on ARM7
